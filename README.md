Implementation of Fixed Point numbers in C using integers. Number of bits
to use for fraction part now configurable at runtime.

For more information about Fixed Point arithmetic:
[Wikipedia: Fixed-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic)

The code implements overflow-safe operations for +, -, *, and /,
following CMU SEI's INT32-C recommendations. For further details:
